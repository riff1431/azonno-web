"""Lint generated component code for hardcoded values that should be design tokens.

The kit's rule is "zero hardcoded values" — every color/size/radius/duration must come
from a token (CSS var, theme key, asset). Point this at YOUR component source.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/lint_hardcodes.py src/components            # a dir
  python3 scripts/lint_hardcodes.py Button.tsx Card.vue       # files
  python3 scripts/lint_hardcodes.py --ext .tsx,.vue src/

Flags a line with a raw hex color, px length, or ms/s duration UNLESS it:
  - is inside a CSS var / token reference (var(--…), {token…}, theme(…)),
  - is a token-definition file (tokens/*.json),
  - carries an inline allow comment containing 'ds-allow-hardcode'.
Exit 0 = clean, 1 = violations found.
