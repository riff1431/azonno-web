"""Verify every CSS variable a component references is DEFINED in the shared theme.

This is the precision gate: a component that uses var(--color-foo) which the theme never
defines renders wrong (a "floating token" = drift = inconsistency across pages). It also
proves theme + components stay in lock-step.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/validate_theme_refs.py                          # defaults to examples/golden
  python3 scripts/validate_theme_refs.py theme.css src/           # your theme + your code
  python3 scripts/validate_theme_refs.py --theme a.css --theme b.css src/
Exit 0 = every referenced var resolves; 1 = a reference resolves to nothing.

A page composes its theme from more than one file and then defines a few of its
own on top, so a single theme file was never the whole answer: --theme repeats,
and a custom property defined inside the scanned file counts as defined there.
A reference carrying a fallback - var(--x, 8px) - cannot render wrong, so it is
reported and not failed.
