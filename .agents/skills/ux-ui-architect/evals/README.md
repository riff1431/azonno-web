# Evals — does an agent with this kit actually produce good work?

Every other gate in this repo measures the kit's own files. That answers "is the
system self-consistent", which is not the question that matters. The question that
matters is: **give an agent nothing but this kit and a brief, and is what comes
back any good?**

This suite answers the measurable half of that honestly, and refuses to fake the
rest.

## The protocol

There are two ways to get a genuine cold start. The second one is what this repo
actually uses, because it can be run on demand.

**A. A fresh human session.** Open a new session in a directory with the kit
installed and paste the brief. No prior conversation, no hints.

**B. A blind subagent.** Scaffold a clean project (`npx ux-ui-agent-skills new
<dir>`, which installs the kit but ships no example screens), then hand a subagent
the brief and the project path and nothing else. The subagent does not see the
conversation that built the kit, so it meets `CLAUDE.md` and the rules the way a
new user's agent does. Setup facts (where the project is, where to write output)
are allowed; design hints, trap warnings, and gate coaching are not. If the agent
finds the verification workflow on its own and runs it, that is the kit working,
and it counts as a result rather than as cheating.


1. **Cold start.** Open a fresh session in a directory that has the kit installed
   (`npx ux-ui-agent-skills init`, or a repo scaffolded with
   `npx ux-ui-agent-skills new`). No prior conversation, no hints, no follow-up
   coaching. Coaching the agent through the brief invalidates the run.
2. **Give it the brief, verbatim.** Paste the body of `briefs/<id>.md`. Nothing
   else. If you find yourself explaining what you meant, the brief needs editing
   rather than the run needing rescuing.
3. **Collect the output** into `evals/out/<brief-id>/` as `.html` files.
4. **Score the measurable half:**

   ```
   node evals/run.mjs <brief-id>
   ```

   Fourteen objective gates on the real render: hardcodes, emoji, WCAG in light
   and dark, state-aware contrast, axe, responsive at 280/320/414, the same widths
   again under a 1.25x root font (a wider fallback font on another platform, or a
   user with larger text), target size, keyboard, reduced motion, content overflow,
   token by intent, slop tells, and interactive truth - a control that declares
   `aria-sort` or `aria-pressed` has to change something when it is clicked. One
   `N/N`, all or nothing.

5. **Judge the half no script can.** Run `/critique` on the output, then read the
   brief's Requirements list yourself. That list is where the real failures live:
   a Cancel button in the wrong colour, an empty state that says "No data", forty
   identical cards with no focal point.

## What a run tells you

| Result | Reading |
|---|---|
| Objective gates fail | The kit did not transfer. Either the brief did not reach the rules, or a rule is preached but not enforced. Both are kit bugs, not agent bugs. |
| Objective green, requirements fail | The kit enforces correctness but not judgement. This is where the taste layer and `/critique` earn their place. |
| Both green | One brief passed. That is evidence, not proof, and it is worth exactly one data point. |

The second row is the interesting one. When a requirement fails repeatedly across
runs, the fix is usually a new gate, and that is how `verify_keyboard`,
`lint_intent`, and the rest were born: a rule the kit preached and nothing checked.

## Keeping the harness honest

`node evals/run.mjs --self-test` scores the kit's own reference app with the exact
same gates. It runs inside `scripts/accuracy_report.mjs`, so a runner that quietly
breaks fails the build instead of silently reporting success on nothing.

Building it found two real defects the 34-check gate had missed: the reference app
overflowed at 280px, and `verify_overflow` was flagging screen-reader-only text as
silently clipped. Both are fixed.

## What this is not

It is not a benchmark, and it does not produce a percentage for quality. Fourteen
gates passing means the work is correct, not that it is good. The briefs list a
"Known traps" section precisely because those traps are what separates the two,
and no script in this repo can see them.
